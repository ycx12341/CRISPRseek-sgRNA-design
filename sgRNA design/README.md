## Design and selection of sgRNAs ## 

This folder contains an example of calling CRISPRseek to design sgRNAs for the target regions obtained in folder **Sequence extraction** and further selecting them based on the predicted efficacy. 

**CRISPRseek results**: this sub-folder demonstrates an example of calling CRISPRseek to design sgRNAs for the target regions. 

**Results filtering and selection**: this sub-folder demonstrates an example of filtering and selecting the top sgRNAs for the target regions based on the predicted efficacy. 

See the README.md file within the sub-folders for more details.
